# StyleSeed update
## Registry-first artifact boundary

When `.styleseed/project.json` and `.styleseed/artifacts/index.json` exist, resolve the requested artifact ID first, then read only `.styleseed/bundles/<artifact-id>.md` and `.styleseed/manifests/<artifact-id>.json`. Never fall back to the global legacy bundle for a registry project. Legacy projects may use `.styleseed/effective-rules.md` only when no registry exists.

Update the **engine payload**, not the user's product UI. A release version describes a published
line; `engineRevision` identifies the exact maintained rules, skills, entry docs, and palette
engine. Two installs with the same release version are not proven equal until their revisions
match.

The checker verifies the payload for the active install channel. A repository/plugin checkout
uses the full `core` inventory; a project-local Agent Skills install uses the executable `skills`
inventory. The published endpoint must expose both the engine `revision` and, for a skills-only
install, `skillsRevision`. The project manifest continues to record the engine revision that
compiled its method bundle.

The bundled catalog also records `distributionSource.channel`. `edge` follows the mutable public
repository state; `stable` follows the latest published release manifest. Do not compare a stable
archive directly to edge `main` unless the user explicitly requests a channel switch.

## When not to use

- First installation → `/ss-setup` or `$ss-setup`.
- One new screen or component → `/ss-build`, `/ss-page`, or `/ss-component`.
- A redesign of old UI → update first, then offer the optional retrofit step below.
- A heavily forked StyleSeed payload → stop after the dry-run report and request a manual diff.

## Ownership boundary

StyleSeed owns installed `ss-*` skill payloads and compiled `.styleseed/effective-rules.md`.
The project owns `STYLESEED.md`, application code, components, tokens, assets, and any existing
`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or Cursor instructions. Never overwrite project-owned files merely to
update StyleSeed.

An update may change design-method behavior, especially across major versions. It is reversible
through the user's version control, but it is not correct to promise that every update is
additive or non-breaking.

## Step 1 — Read-only revision check

From the user's project root, run the bundled checker by its installed path:

```bash
node <installed-ss-update>/scripts/check-update.mjs --project-root . --json
```

Interpret the result exactly:

- `current` — installed and published revisions match; stop unless the user explicitly wants a
  reinstall.
- `update-available` — refresh the installed payload even when the semantic versions match.
- `project-bundle-stale` — skills are current; skip reinstall and re-resolve the project.
- `legacy-skill-conflict` — the retired standalone seven-category reviewer remains beside the
  canonical skills. Show its path and hash; remove it only after confirming it is not a
  project-modified skill.
- `remote-revision-unavailable` — version-only evidence cannot prove currency. Report the
  boundary and do not say “up to date.”

For registry projects, also read the sorted `artifacts` array. Its status is computed from the
current artifact contract, manifest, declared output bytes, and installed catalog every time:

- `current` — method, validation contract, and output bytes still match;
- `corrupt` — a declared bundle/palette is missing or its bytes do not match;
- `method-changed` — recompile, then rerun every implementation/render evidence gate;
- `validation-changed` — recompile only when reported, and rerun the gates marked `stale`;
- `metadata-changed` — recompile for the installed engine metadata; unchanged visual evidence is
  not invalidated by metadata alone;
- `legacy` — migrate the artifact before claiming artifact-level currency.

`changedInputs` names project-owned inputs whose current normalized bytes differ from the manifest.
When prior validation details are unavailable, the checker fails closed by marking every potentially
affected gate stale; it does not invent a precise field-level history from a digest.

Also inspect `git status --short`. Do not modify files during this step.

## Step 2 — Report the update boundary

Before changing anything, report:

```text
StyleSeed update report
- Installed: <version> @ <revision>
- Installed channel: <stable|edge|legacy-edge>
- Installed payload: <core|skills> @ <distribution revision>
- Published: <version> @ <revision>
- Project bundle: <version/revision or not resolved>
- Project worktree: clean | has existing changes
- Will refresh: canonical ss-* skill payloads
- Will preserve: STYLESEED.md, app code, components, tokens, assets, project instructions
- Requires review: compiled rule-bundle diff and any copied legacy engine docs
```

If the worktree has unrelated changes, preserve them. Recommend a commit or backup before a
method update, but do not use destructive reset/checkout commands as an update strategy.

## Step 3 — Refresh through the original install channel

Use the same channel that installed StyleSeed:

- Edge Agent Skills CLI installation: run the returned `installed.install` command (normally
  `npx skills add bitjaru/styleseed`) and select the same project/provider scope.
- Stable Agent Skills CLI installation: run `npx skills add <remote.archiveUrl> --agent codex
  --yes --copy`, using the exact latest published archive URL returned by the checker.
- Claude/plugin or another provider marketplace: use that provider's normal update action.
- Vendored source checkout: fetch the intended tag or commit, review the diff, and update the
  canonical engine as a set. Do not mix files from two revisions.

Do not implement an update with a blind recursive copy into an existing skills directory. The
installer must reconcile the managed payload; project-owned files stay outside that operation.
Do not silently change `stable` to `edge` or `edge` to `stable` during refresh.

If this skill was invoked only to inspect availability, stop before the external refresh and
present the report.

## Step 4 — Prove the installed revision

Run the new checker's path again. Require the installed and published `engineRevision` values to
match before describing the engine as current. A matching version string by itself is not proof.

If the installed payload still reports the old revision, stop. Do not recompile the project from
a mixed or unproven installation.

## Step 5 — Recompile the project context

For a registry project (`.styleseed/project.json` plus `.styleseed/artifacts/index.json`):

1. Re-resolve each artifact whose result has `bundleRecompileRequired:true` with
   `resolve-context.mjs --project-root . --artifact <id> --agent <agent>`.
2. Run the same command with `--check` and require exit status 0.
3. Preserve artifacts reported `current`; do not overwrite every bundle to update one artifact.

For a legacy project, when `STYLESEED.md` exists:

1. Run the installed `ss-resolve/scripts/resolve-context.mjs` with
   `--project-root . --from-lock STYLESEED.md --agent <agent>`.
2. Inspect the diff for `.styleseed/effective-rules.md`, `.styleseed/manifest.json`, and generated
   palette files. The manifest must record the new `engineRevision`.
3. Run the same command with `--check`; require exit status 0.
4. Report the old and new bundle hashes. Do not use `llms-full.txt` as the project context.

The design lock persists selections, but a new engine revision may correctly change the compiled
method around those selections. Present that diff instead of hiding it.

## Step 6 — Check legacy copied docs

Older projects may contain copied `DESIGN-LANGUAGE.md`, `PRODUCT-PRINCIPLES.md`, `RULESETS.md`,
or provider entry files. Detect and report them. Do not overwrite project `AGENTS.md`,
`CLAUDE.md`, or `.cursorrules`; recommend replacing only an identifiable StyleSeed-managed block
or removing stale duplicate method files after review.

## Optional retrofit

Updating the engine does not redesign existing screens. If the user wants a retrofit:

1. resolve the selected artifact and its project-owned configuration for registry projects; only when neither registry file exists, confirm or create the legacy `STYLESEED.md`. A partial or invalid registry is an error, not a fallback;
2. re-score the highest-traffic screen against the new effective bundle;
3. use `/ss-review` or `$ss-review` for read-only findings, then apply approved fixes in the authorized implementation step;
4. render and inspect with `/ss-verify` or `$ss-verify`;
5. report before/after evidence without claiming the old score was measured when it was not.

Stop on pass or after three correction passes per gate, including delegated passes. Report
remaining failures and actual evidence; invoking another skill does not reset this budget.

## Completion report

Separate these states:

- installed revision: verified | not verified;
- project bundle: recompiled and hash-checked | stale | not present;
- application code: unchanged | explicitly retrofitted;
- code gate: passed | not run;
- visual gate: passed from inspected render | not run.

Never call installation, compilation, a build, or a score a visual verification.
