# Resolve effective StyleSeed context

Use the bundled `scripts/resolve-context.mjs`; do not hand-compose the rule stack.

1. Resolve the project boundary first: if either `.styleseed/project.json` or
   `.styleseed/artifacts/index.json` exists, require a complete, valid registry. Do not fall back
   to `STYLESEED.md` on a registry error. Only use that lock when no registry exists.
2. Keep the working directory at the user's project root. Invoke the script by its installed
   path; do not `cd` into the skill directory.
3. Legacy single-artifact projects should prefer `--from-lock STYLESEED.md`. Registry projects use
   `.styleseed/project.json` plus `.styleseed/artifacts/*.json` and must resolve with `--artifact`
   or `--all`; in registry mode, edit project-owned config instead of passing selection overrides.
4. Read the emitted bundle before building: legacy writes `.styleseed/effective-rules.md`; registry
   writes `.styleseed/bundles/<artifact-id>.md`.
5. Preserve the manifest output: legacy uses `.styleseed/manifest.json`; registry uses
   `.styleseed/manifests/<artifact-id>.json`.
6. Use `--check` to detect context drift without rewriting files.

For installation or project-health questions, run the read-only diagnostic first:

```bash
node <installed-ss-resolve>/scripts/styleseed-doctor.mjs --project-root . --json
```

It checks the local distribution inventory, project configuration, compiled rules, and stored
evidence against current inputs. Use `--artifact <id>` to narrow a registry check. It never
sets up, migrates, recompiles, renders, or updates the project. Follow its `next` actions only
within the user's authorization. Exit 0 means current evidence for all selected artifacts,
not an independent visual judgment; exit 1 means attention needed; exit 2 means invalid invocation.
Legacy projects can have current rules while evidence remains `unsupported`. Installation
integrity does not prove host discovery, publisher authenticity, or the latest upstream revision.

```bash
node <installed-ss-resolve>/scripts/resolve-context.mjs \
  --from-lock STYLESEED.md \
  --agent codex
```

Registry project:

```bash
node <installed-ss-resolve>/scripts/resolve-context.mjs \
  --project-root . \
  --artifact app-dashboard \
  --agent codex
```

Without a lock:

```bash
node <installed-ss-resolve>/scripts/resolve-context.mjs \
  --agent claude \
  --grammar operations-console \
  --adapter product-ui \
  --domain saas \
  --page dashboard \
  --recipe enterprise-workbench \
  --palette cobalt-instrument \
  --key-color "#175CD3" \
  --palette-character balanced \
  --palette-mode light \
  --palette-harmony auto \
  --surface-temperature cool \
  --profile swiss
```

Use `--list` to print supported IDs. `--recipe auto` maps the selected grammar to a maintained
default; `--palette auto` maps that recipe to a contrast-verified semantic palette. Pass explicit
values when the product needs a different morphology or color posture. The default
output directory is `.styleseed/` in the
project root. For a project-local reference grammar, pass `reference:<slug>` and ensure
`.styleseed/rulesets/<slug>/RULESET.md` exists. Registry projects require the full six-file
reference contract: `RULESET.md`, `tokens.json`, `evidence.json`, `checks.md`,
`reference-board.html`, and `adapter.json`.

When a key color is present in flags or the lock, the resolver uses the shared OKLCH generator and
writes `.styleseed/palette.json` plus `.styleseed/palette.css`. The manifest records the generation
inputs. The maintained recipe still supplies product posture and semantic restrictions; its fixed
hex values become fallbacks rather than overriding the generated system.

Do not load `llms-full.txt` after a bundle resolves successfully. Load a larger source document
only when the bundle names an unresolved ambiguity that requires it.
